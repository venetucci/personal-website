I work on various fiber projects, mainly focusing on quilting and knitting with natural fibers. I'm currently working an ongoing series of collaborative AI electronic quilts; working out of a hackerspace in San Francisco, a group of us are designing quilts using Stable Diffusion, and then producing them in the sewing room. Our current projects also incorporate circuit hacking and motion sensors. Below is a selection of these projects, with updates over at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lowtechfibers/">@lowtechfibers</a>.

## From Cyberculture to Fiberculture #1, 2023
<i>Cotton fabric, cotton batting, invisible thread. Sewn on a domestic sewing machine.</i><br>

Stable Diffusion was used to generate a quilt design. Fabrics were sourced and used to match the design, and sewn together on a domestic machine. This first shot is a finished quilt, based on a pattern generated by a stable diffusion build. Scroll down to see the generated image next to the in-real-life quilt.

## Tenses: Text-to-Textile Quilt (in progress April 2023)
<i>Produced by Dr. Emeline Brulé & Michelle Venetucci. Materials include cotton fabric, cotton batting, polyester thread. Sewn using a domestic sewing machine and programmable Singer Futura Quartet embroidery machine. Designed and produced using Inkscape, Ink/Stitch, Singer Futura Quartet software, Stable Diffusion, ChatGPT.</i><br>

For this project, we used Stable Diffusion to generate images of letters of the alphabet, which were then converted into a vector that was sent to a programmable embroidery machine.

We’re using thread and fabric in matching colors as a callback to an embroidery practice called whitework that gradually disappeared over the 20th century, where white embroidery was used on white fabric. We used ChatGPT to come up with a color scheme for the quilt, asking it to suggest colors and a layout inspired by San Francisco. It gave us some colors associated with mechanical components of the city, like the orange of the bridge and cable car red, alongside natural components, like foggy gray and ocean blue.

## Selected knitting, 2018-2023
<i>Cotton and alpaca wool</i><br>

My great aunt taught me to knit when I was about 10 years old, sitting in her farmhouse sun room in Colorado Springs. Here are some selected projects from the past 5 years, mostly made with cotton or alpaca wool yarn.
