These are books and papers that I found some sort of value out of reading this year. I âœ¨ my favorites at the end of a year, and try to record author identity metrics (â™‚ â™€ ðŸ”¹ ðŸ”¸). I sometimes forget to update this, and sometimes I take notes, link to source material, or otherwise provide more context in a link below. [Historically I tracked this on GitHub.](https://github.com/venetucci/book-notes)
