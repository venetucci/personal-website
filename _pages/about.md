As an undergraduate studying anthropology and urban planning, I was interested in exploring how individual health and wellbeing is often determined by food landscapes, physical surroundings, and access to transportation. As a product designer working on contemporary tech products, I became curious about how to apply these frameworks to the digital products humans use on a daily basis. After working inside the industry and seeing larger impacts and cultural shifts stemming from the integration of new technologies into societal systems, I became more interested in the connection between the myths and rhetoric surrounding technology, the incentive and cultural structures that guide industry activities, and these end outcomes.

I am a PhD student in the [Yale Anthropology department](https://anthropology.yale.edu/) in the sociocultural track, with an emphasis on Science & Technology Studies (STS).

#### Interests

STS, anthropology of technology, capitalism, corporate studies, public anthropology, historical anthropology, community formation and subversion, subject formation and agency.
